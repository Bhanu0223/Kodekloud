Due to an accidental data mix-up, user data was unintentionally mingled on Nautilus App Server 2 at the /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. To rectify this, specific user data needs to be filtered and relocated. Here are the details: Locate all files (excluding directories) owned by user ammar within the /home/usersdata directory on App Server 2. Copy these files while preserving the directory structure to the /official directory.

sol:

We need to:

Find only files (not directories)

Owned by user ammar

Under /home/usersdata

Copy them to /official

Preserve the directory structure


The best command for this is:
'''bash
sudo find /home/usersdata -type f -user ammar -exec cp --parents {} /official \;
'''


What this does:

find /home/usersdata → search inside this directory

-type f → only files (exclude directories)

-user ammar → files owned by user ammar

cp --parents → copies files while keeping the original directory path

{} → each file found

/official → destination directory

After running it, the structure under /official will mirror the paths from /home/usersdata for only ammar’s files

You can verify with:
'''bash
find /official -type f
'''
