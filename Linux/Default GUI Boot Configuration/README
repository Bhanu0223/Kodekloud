With the installation of new tools on the app servers within the Stratos Datacenter, certain functionalities now necessitate graphical user interface (GUI) access.


Adjust the default runlevel on all App servers in Stratos Datacenter to enable GUI booting by default. It's imperative not to initiate a server reboot after completing this task.



#########################
On each App Server, set the system to boot into GUI mode by default:

sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target


This changes the default runlevel to graphical (GUI) without rebooting the server.

You can verify the change with:

systemctl get-default


It should return:

graphical.target


Do not reboot the servers after this, as per the requirement.
