In the Stratos Datacenter, our Storage server is encountering performance degradation due to excessive processes held by the nfsuser user. To mitigate this issue, we need to enforce limitations on its maximum processes. Please set the maximum process limits as specified below:


a. Set the soft limit to 1025


b. Set the hard limit to 2026

sol:

On the Storage Server, edit the limits configuration:

sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf


Add these lines at the end:

nfsuser   soft   nproc   1025
nfsuser   hard   nproc   2026


Explanation (short):

nfsuser → user to limit

soft nproc 1025 → warning limit (can be exceeded temporarily)

hard nproc 2026 → absolute maximum processes

These limits will take effect on the next login session of nfsuser.
