xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:


a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 1.


b. Apache should serve on port 8085.


c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/ecommerce and /home/thor/apps on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that ecommerce should work on the link http://localhost:8085/ecommerce/ and apps should work on link http://localhost:8085/apps/ on the mentioned app server.


d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:8085/ecommerce/ and curl http://localhost:8085/apps/


########################################################
solution:1️⃣ Install Apache
sudo yum install -y httpd

2️⃣ Configure Apache to listen on port 8085

Edit the config:

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf


Find:

Listen 80


Change to:

Listen 8085

3️⃣ Copy website backups from jump host

From App Server 1, copy both directories:

scp -r thor@jump_host:/home/thor/ecommerce /var/www/html/
scp -r thor@jump_host:/home/thor/apps /var/www/html/


Set proper ownership:

sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/ecommerce /var/www/html/apps

4️⃣ Start and enable Apache
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd


Verify it is listening:

ss -lntp | grep 8085

5️⃣ Test locally on App Server 1
curl http://localhost:8085/ecommerce/
curl http://localhost:8085/apps/


You should see the content from each respective site.

Result
