The DevOps team established a new Git repository last week, which remains unused at present. However, the Nautilus application development team now requires a copy of this repository on the Storage Server in the Stratos DC. Follow the provided details to clone the repository:


The repository to be cloned is located at /opt/ecommerce.git


Clone this Git repository to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Perform this task using the natasha user, and ensure that no modifications are made to the repository or existing directories, such as changing permissions or making unauthorized alterations.

################

Do this on the Storage Server and make sure you are working as user natasha.

1️⃣ Switch to user natasha
sudo -i -u natasha

2️⃣ Ensure the destination directory exists

Do not change any permissions—only create it if it doesn’t exist.

mkdir -p /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

3️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone /opt/ecommerce.git /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce


This will create a working copy of the repository inside:

/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce

4️⃣ Verify
ls /usr/src/kodekloudrepos


You should see:

ecommerce


And confirm it’s a Git repo:

ls /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce/.git


✔ Repository cloned from /opt/ecommerce.git
✔ Location: /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce
✔ Performed as user natasha
✔ No permissions or existing directories modified
